# Web-GeoBI---TERRITORIAL CONFLICTS

This Proof of Concept was developed using fictitious geospatial data from two artificially created data sources to cross-reference rural areas from different data sources and find intersections (or overlaps). For educational purposes, I designated one as Indigenous lands and the other as rural properties in three Brazilian states. Maps, graphs, and metrics were calculated. This type of "front-end" with real geospatial data can help different agencies resolve territorial conflicts between their respective databases, improving their quality. This "front-end" was developed using open-source JavaScript technology (React + Leaflet + Google Charts).
